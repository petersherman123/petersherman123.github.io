I am a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor Michael B. McElroy in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. I previously completed a PhD at Harvard (Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences) and a joint bachelor-masters degree Imperial College London (Department of Physics). My research interests are broad, focusing on grid integration of renewable technologies, but also on regional climate change. If you have interest in discussing work or collaborating, please feel free to contact me at [petersherman@g.harvard.edu](mailto:petersherman@g.harvard.edu)
